Explanation of Video and Process:
Our project is a great tool for a roadtrip. The user types in where they are going, and our program displays the route. From there based on the temperature of the location you are going to, it will generate a playlist to get you excited for the weather you are about to endure! For example if you go to Miami, the playlist will be warm vibes playlist from Spotify and if you are going to Massachusetts, it will gives you a cold vibes playlist from Spotify. We hope you enjoy!
